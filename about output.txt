After you start the game:

the aim is to guess the correct word.
if the letter is not in the word the the letter turns red
and a further stage of the hangman is drawn (left upper corner)

if the is in the word it is displayed in the blank. The letter gets disabled.


if you get the word correct before the hangman is drawn you win the game else you lose.


The new game button would do what a new game button does....Start a new game :P


That's it..... i hope you enjoy the game .
